# Supervised-Models
First Repository:

Hey, 
I am a data scientist aspirant having sound understanding of Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Knn, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ensemble Techniques such as Bagging ,Boosting, Stacking, Pasting , Voting Classifier.

I have been practicing in the following areas using real time datasets.


• Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring Trends
• Feature Engineering: Creating/modifying new features
• Modeling: Choosing the algorithms


----Tools i have been using are SQL, Python and Tableau.


This marks my first repository and the main aim of creating this repository is to help out newbies like me  who have just startedor will be starting their career in machine learning or model building as a matter of fact.

 
How is my repository useful?
I will try my best to be an Open Source Contributor for Data Science, Machine Learning.
I will be sharing my own codes and information related to each and every Machine Learning model and algorithm.
Each file will contain important concepts related to a model and how that model is coded.
Comments will be added which will showcase the explaination for coding in a lay man language.
