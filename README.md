# Supervised-Models
First Repository:

Hey, 
I am a data scientist aspirant . I am from a non technical background but have invested my last 6 months learning SQL, Python, Tableau, Statistical Modelling and Machine Learning.
I am still learning happily. 

This marks my first repository and the main aim of creating this repository is to help out newbies like me  who have just startedor will be starting their career in machine learning or model building as a matter of fact.

 
How is my repository useful?
I will be sharing my own codes and information related to each and every Machine Learning model and algorithm.
Each file will contain important concepts related to a model and how that model is coded.
Comments will be added which will showcase the explaination for coding in a lay man language.
